This project demonstrates the use of SQL for analyzing a movie dataset inspired by IMDB. It includes over 18 practical queries that answer real-world questions about movie ratings, genres, certifications, directors, and actors.


 üìå Project Overview

- Designed and created the `Movie_Ratings` table to store movie-related attributes such as title, year, genre, IMDb rating, certificate, director, cast, etc.
- Wrote SQL queries to extract insights using filtering, aggregation, and set operations.
- This project is suitable for beginners and intermediate learners looking to enhance their SQL skills.


 üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- SQL (Structured Query Language)
- Any RDBMS (MySQL, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, SQLite, etc.)
- Query Editor / IDE (e.g., MySQL Workbench, SSMS, DBeaver, or VS Code with SQL extension)


 üîç Key SQL Concepts Applied

- `CREATE TABLE`, `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS`
- `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `LIKE`, `IN`, `IS NULL`
- `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `ORDER BY`
- `COUNT`, `SUM`, `MAX`, `MIN`
- `UNION`
- `BETWEEN`, logical operators (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`)
